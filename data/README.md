Dataset Information

This project uses the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset, which consists of brain CT scan images in DICOM format. The dataset contains labeled samples for multiple types of intracranial hemorrhage, including epidural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhage, along with non-hemorrhage cases.

Each CT scan is associated with one or more class labels, making the task a multi-label classification problem. Due to dataset size and licensing restrictions, the original images are not included in this repository. Users can obtain the dataset directly from the RSNA Kaggle competition page and organize it according to the project requirements.
